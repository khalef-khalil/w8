  "educationWhyFluctuatesTitle": "Why Weight Fluctuates Daily",
  "educationWhyFluctuatesContent": "Your weight naturally fluctuates throughout the day and week. This is completely normal! Factors include:\n\n• Water retention (can vary by 1-2 kg)\n• Food and digestion\n• Sleep quality and duration\n• Hormonal changes\n• Exercise and muscle recovery\n\nThat's why we use a 7-day rolling median for your current weight and weekly medians in charts - they smooth out daily noise and show your true progress.",
  "educationWeeklyMediansTitle": "How We Smooth Your Data",
  "educationWeeklyMediansContent": "Your current weight on the overview is a 7-day rolling median: the median of all weigh-ins in the last 7 days (or your last weigh-in if none in that window). This keeps the number responsive and robust to outliers.\n\nCharts use weekly medians: we take the median weight for each full week (Mon–Sun). That gives a stable trend over time. For example: if you weigh 70kg, 71kg, 70.5kg, 70.2kg, and 70.8kg in a week, the median is 70.5kg - a more stable number than any single day.",
  "educationBestPracticesTitle": "Best Practices for Tracking",
  "educationBestPracticesContent": "For the most accurate tracking:\n\n• Weigh at the same time each day (morning is best)\n• Use the same scale\n• Weigh before eating or drinking\n• Weigh after using the bathroom\n• Wear similar clothing (or none)\n\nConsistency is more important than perfection!",
  "educationPlateausTitle": "Understanding Plateaus",
  "educationPlateausContent": "Weight plateaus are completely normal and not a sign of failure!\n\nYour body may:\n• Retain water during muscle recovery\n• Adjust metabolism\n• Redistribute weight (fat loss, muscle gain)\n\nIf you're following your plan, trust the process. Plateaus often break after a few weeks. Focus on consistency over speed.",
  "educationContextTrackingTitle": "Why Track Context?",
  "educationContextTrackingContent": "Tracking context (sleep, stress, exercise, meal timing) helps you understand patterns.\n\nYou might discover:\n• Better sleep = better weight management\n• High stress affects your progress\n• Exercise timing matters\n• Meal timing impacts daily weight\n\nThese insights help you make informed decisions about your journey.",
  "educationStayingMotivatedTitle": "Staying Motivated",
  "educationStayingMotivatedContent": "Weight tracking is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nRemember:\n• Progress isn't always linear\n• Small daily actions compound over time\n• Setbacks are part of the journey\n• Celebrate non-scale victories too\n\nFocus on building sustainable habits. Every day you track is a win!"
